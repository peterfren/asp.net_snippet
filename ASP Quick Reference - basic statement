ASP Cookies
A cookie is often used to identify a user. A cookie is a small file that the server embeds on the user's computer. Each time the same computer requests for a page with a browser, it will send the cookie too.

The Response.Cookies command is used to create cookies:

<%
Response.Cookies("firstname")="Alex"
Response.Cookies("firstname").Expires="May 10,2002"
%>
